            <h3>What in the world is Paprika?</h3>
            <p>Paprika is a deep orange-red ground spice made from dried fruits of the larger and sweeter varieties of Capsicum annum called bell pepper or sweet peppers. It is commonly used as a garnish on soups, stews or appetizers, but its flavor is truly released when its is heated through. Paprika is also named as the fourth most consumed spiced in the world.<br><br>There's not just one variety of paprika; thus its flavor could vary depending on where it's from and the type of peppers used. Thus the flavors could range from sweet to mild to red hot. </p>
